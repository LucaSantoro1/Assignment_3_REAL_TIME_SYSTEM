# Assignment_3_REAL_TIME_SYSTEM
Create a real-time application composed of at least three periodic tasks with different periods. Execute your application on VxWorks (on the vxsim0 virtual target or on if you have access to a supported microcontroller, you can use that as a physical target) and study its behaviour using SystemViewer.

This assignment consists of implementing and analyzing an application of your own compilation and commenting on its behavior. The analysed application is composed of 3 harmonic periodic tasks which share 2 different, non-preemptable resources Ra and Rb; The considered application of three tasks is scheduled considering just a single processor machine, applying the Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP) to solve the priority inversion problem.
